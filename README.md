# Candyspace Technical Test

## Brief explanation of workings

I saved the json file locally then in main.js pulled the json data and used a for loop to loop over the first 20 items. I then wrote HTML code to display first 20 items title and thumbnailUrl values as Bootstrap cards in the DOM. Finally I applied some styling using scss to add an animation to the cards on hover and invert the colors of the card body when the user hovers over that section of the card.

When deploying the site using GitHub pages I had issues getting the correct file path for the url but after some research and some playing around managed to fix this.

The main build took aproximately 1.5 hours and then fixing the deployment took roughly another 2 hours through some trial and error!
